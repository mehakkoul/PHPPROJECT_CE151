                                                <p>“The GST revenues during March 2021 are the highest since introduction of GST,” said an official statement released by the Ministry of Finance. </p>

                                                    In line with the trend of recovery in GST revenues over past five months, revenues for March were 27 per cent higher than the GST revenues in the same month last year. Revenues from import of goods were 70 per cent higher and revenues from domestic transaction (including import of services) were 17 per cent higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year.
													<br />
													The GST revenue witnessed a de-growth rate of 41 per cent, 8 per cent, 8 per cent and 14 per cent in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of FY21 as compared to the same period last year, indicating a trend in recovery of GST revenues as well as economy as a whole.
													<br />
													GST revenues crossed above Rs 1 lakh crore mark at a stretch for the last six months. A steep increasing trend over this period are clear indicators of rapid economic recovery post pandemic, said the Ministry of Finance.

												Closer monitoring against fake-billing, deep data analytics using data from multiple sources including GST, income-tax and customs IT systems and effective tax administration have also contributed to the steady increase in tax revenue over last few months, it said. (AGENCY)
